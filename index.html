						<p class="lead" id="lead"><b> A passion for technology and connecting people</b></p> 
						<p>is how my journey as a software developer began. Perhaps the greatest aspect of code is its undeniable reach, 
							and ability to promote positive change, from individual to a broad scale. Therein, I discovered the intrinsic 
							allure necessary for translating a coding hobby into a career. Currently, I'm enjoying learning about
							design, and working with front-end technologies such as JavaScript and its many frameworks. Futhermore, I've learned the basics
							of Swift, and I'll be looking forward to delving into iOS app development soon. <br>

							&emsp;When I'm not in my coding-cave, I love connecting with my community through tech. 
							Besides participating in countless student-led programming events (called Hackathons) at various universities,
							I am one among few organizers of Florida International University’s own largest Hackathon, MangoHacks.
							MangoHacks hosts 500 students and various company sponsors for 36 hours of creative thinking, coding, and learning, giving students the opportunity to network among themselves, with companies, and learn at workshops. 
							Also, I tutor programming students and grade their assignments weekly under the supervision of Dr. Davis at Florida International University
							in Miami, FL.

								<h2> Education </h2><br>
									<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-education"></span><br>
								<p>
									In 2016, I received a Bachelors in Psychology/Criminal Justice from
									Florida International University. Currently, I'm working towards my 
									Bachelors in IT-Software Engineering, expecting to graduate by Fall of
									2019. Aside from my school work, I enjoy refining my JavaScript
									and Java skills on online resources such as pluralsight and codeacademy. 
								</p>

							<div class="col-md-4 ">
								<h2> Projects </h2><br>
								<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-folder-open"></span><br>
								<p>
									As of recently, my work was concentrated on using data structures in Java programs,
									though I am now learning to combine my academic knowledge with industry-level
									skills. I will be updating my website as I complete my upcoming projects!
								</p>

									<h2> Goals </h2><br>
									<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-road"></span><br>
									<p>
										The lessons I’ve learned in computer programming are far beyond my curriculum of data structures and abstract math —
										I have discovered perseverance, the courage to make mistakes, the humility of continuously learning, 
										and the value of participating in my community.<br>
										These small wisdoms granted me perspective for my long term goals. 
										I aim to continue improving my technical skills while utilizing them in meaningful ways. My next stop: React.JS, Swift, and some ideation for a web-app/iOS app to benefit my community.
